# servless-photo-upload


## Overview

This project demonstrates a serverless photo upload application built using AWS Lambda, S3, and IAM.
The Lambda function uploads photos to an S3 bucket and returns the public URL of the uploaded image.

## Architecture 

User → IAM -> Lambda → S3 Bucket 

## Services used:

AWS Lambda – Handles the file upload logic.

Amazon S3 – Stores uploaded images.

IAM – Grants permissions for Lambda to access S3.

## Steps to Deploy

1️⃣ Create an S3 Bucket

Open AWS Console → S3 → Create bucket

Name it something unique, e.g. serverlessphotouploadbucket

Keep ACLs enabled and Block all public access unchecked (optional — can change later).

Click Create bucket

2️⃣ Make S3 Bucket Public

If you get an “Access Denied” XML when opening your uploaded image, your bucket isn’t public.

➤ Disable Block Public Access

Go to S3 → Your Bucket → Permissions → Block public access

Click Edit

Uncheck all boxes

Save changes

➤ Add Bucket Policy

Go to Permissions → Bucket Policy and paste:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadForObjects",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*", 
       "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::serverlessphotouploadbucket/*" 
    }
    
  ]
}

✅ This allows public read access for all files inside your bucket.


3️⃣ Create IAM Role for Lambda

Go to IAM → Roles → Create Role

Choose AWS Service → Lambda

Attach the following policies:

AmazonS3FullAccess

AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole

Click Create Role

4️⃣ Create Lambda Function

Go to Lambda → Create function

Choose Author from scratch

Function name: PhotoUploadHandler

Runtime: Python 3.9

Choose the IAM role created above

Click Create function

5️⃣ Add Lambda Code

6️⃣ Deploy and Test

Click Deploy

Click Test

Create a test event with base64 image data or dummy text

Run the test

You should see:

{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "body": "{\"message\": \"✅ File uploaded successfully!\", \"file_url\": \"https://serverlessphotouploadbucket.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/your_image.jpg\"}"
}




✅ Output Example

File uploaded successfully!
URL: https://musuujljeipo3ylarkb6vowen40godcj.lambda-url.ap-south-1.on.aws/

## Advantages

No servers needed – Fully serverless, so no EC2 setup or maintenance.

Low cost – Pay only for what you use (Lambda, S3, API calls).

Auto scaling – Can handle many uploads at the same time automatically.

High availability – AWS services ensure your app runs 24/7.

Secure uploads – Uses IAM roles and policies for controlled access.

## Disadvantages

Cold start delay – First Lambda call may take a few seconds to start.

Limited runtime – Lambda has execution time and memory limits.

Public access risk – If S3 is not configured properly, files can be exposed.

Debugging is harder – Logs are in CloudWatch, not as easy as local debugging.

Complex permissions – IAM role setup must be correct, or uploads may fail.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to build a Serverless Photo Upload Application using AWS Lambda and Amazon S3, without managing any servers.

It’s a great hands-on project to understand:

How serverless architecture works

How AWS services integrate with each other (Lambda, S3, IAM)

How to make cloud-based applications secure and efficient
